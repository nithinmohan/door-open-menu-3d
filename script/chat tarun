no
i saw it in github

i just wrote 5 lines

I can't seem to fadeIn or fadeout ".main"
i replaced addClass("hide") with fadeOut(1000)
doesn't waork

i will check it and push if possible within half an hour otherwise leave it

da
wait
see i commented out the code abov addclass"hide"
both, addClass and removeClass
but it still works
I think its beacuse you must have played with textheader and textcontent
Why does that happen, you haven't touched text content

where?
line number?

24
search for .main
and 39
